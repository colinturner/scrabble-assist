# Scrabble Assist

[This project](https://colinturner.github.io/scrabble-assist/) helps you find the right Scrabble words when you can't think of any.

1. Select your language (currently English and German supported).
2. Type in the letters you have in your Scrabble hand (e.g. `evqar`)
3. Optionally constrain the number of extra letters allowed in the suggested words

**Scrabble Assist** will output all words that use every letter in your hand.

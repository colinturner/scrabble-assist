# Scrabble Assist

[This project](https://colinturner.github.io/scrabble-assist/) helps you find the right Scrabble words when you can't think of any.

1. **[English by default]** Select your language: currently English and German supported.
2. **[Optional, but recommended to constrain your results to playable moves]** Type in the letters in your Scrabble hand, where `*` indicates a blank tile (e.g. `apgi*le`).
3. **[Required]** Type in the desired word format, according to the scrabble board (e.g. `b**p&`, where `*` indicates an empty spot on the board and `&` indicates that any number of letters will be accepted in that position).

**Scrabble Assist** will output all the playable words according to your hand and the format of the word on the board.
